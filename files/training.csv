"NGC 1313 is dominated by scattered patches of intense star formation, which gives the galaxy a rather ragged appearance.",structure
"In the late 1970s, François Schweizer studied NGC 1316 extensively and found that the galaxy appeared to look like a small elliptical galaxy with some unusual dust lanes embedded within a much larger envelope of stars.",structure
"The outer envelope contained many ripples, loops, and arcs.",structure
"NGC 1316 is located within the Fornax Cluster, a cluster of galaxies in the constellation Fornax. However, in contrast to Messier 87, which is a similar elliptical galaxy that is located in the center of the Virgo Cluster, NGC 1316 is located at the edge of the Fornax Cluster.",structure
