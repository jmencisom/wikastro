"He described his discovery as ""faint, small, round, between 11th and 14th magnitude stars"" (to the north and south).";observation
"Around the year 964, the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi described the Andromeda Galaxy, in his Book of Fixed Stars as a ""nebulous smear"".";observation
In 1887, Isaac Roberts took the first photographs of Andromeda, which was still commonly thought to be a nebula within our galaxy. ;observation
NGC 62 was discovered by Édouard Stephan from France on 8 October 1883.;observation
The galaxy was discovered by Caroline Herschel in 1783 during one of her systematic comet searches.;observation
As one of the brightest galaxies in the sky, the Sculptor Galaxy can be seen through binoculars and is near the star Beta Ceti.;observation
It is considered one of the most easily viewed galaxies in the sky after the Andromeda Galaxy.;observation
The Sculptor Galaxy is a good target for observation with a telescope with a 300 mm diameter or larger.;observation
In such telescopes, it appears as a galaxy with a long, oval bulge and a mottled disc.;observation
NGC 5128 was discovered on 29 April 1826 by James Dunlop during a survey at the Parramatta Observatory.;observation
"In 1847 John Herschel described the galaxy as ""two semi-ovals of elliptically formed nebula appearing to be cut asunder and separated by a broad obscure band parallel to the larger axis of the nebula, in the midst of which a faint streak of light parallel to the sides of the cut appears.";observation
In 1949 John Gatenby Bolton, Bruce Slee and Gordon Stanley localize NGC 5128 as one of the first extragalactical radio sources.;observation
A team at the University of California, Irvine, led by Asantha Cooray, was the first to detect and characterize HXMM01 in data from the Herschel space telescope's HerMES instrument.;observation
Analyses of the data, published in May 2013,revealed the galaxy to be a merging pair with a mass at least ten times that of the Milky Way.;observation
However, Lewis Swift reported the galaxy independently in on October 22, 1897, at right ascention 9 arcseconds off the location of the galaxy and was included in Index Catalogue as IC 5294;observation
In 1779, Pierre Méchain independently rediscovered both galaxies and reported them to Charles Messier, who added them to his catalog.;observation
Lord Rosse observed M101 in his 72-inch diameter Newtonian reflector during the second half of the 19th century.;observation
NGC 7552 was originally discovered and reported in 1826 by James Dunlop and John Herschel added it in the General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters as number 3977.;observation
NGC 7552 is a barred spiral galaxy, with two spiral arms forming an outer pseudo-ring.;structure
NGC 7010 has broad, plateau shaped shells of stars surrounding it.;structure
NGC 7013 is tilted 90° to the Earth's line of sight, allowing its structure to be seen. However, NGC 7013 is classified as either as a spiral galaxy with tightly wound arms or as a lenticular galaxy.;structure
NGC 7013 is also considered part of a class of galactic nuclei that is defined by their spectral line emissions, called low-ionization nuclear emission-line region galaxies or LINERs.;structure
The galaxy appears to have two rings in its structure.;structure
NGC 7016 is one of two prominent radio galaxies in the galaxy cluster Abell 3744 along with the double galaxy system NGC 7018.;structure
NGC 7020 has a large outer ring surrounding a bright inner hexagonal zone containing an inner ring and possibly a bar.;structure
The large outer ring is completely detached from the inner hexagonal zone of the galaxy and is dominated by numerous flocculent spiral features. ;structure
NGC 7022 appears to be located in the Indus triplet of galaxies which also contains the galaxies NGC 7049, NGC 7041, and NGC 7029.;structure
NGC 6302 has a complex structure, which may be approximated as bipolar with two primary lobes, though there is evidence for a second pair of lobes that may have belonged to a previous phase of mass loss.;structure
This planetary nebula contains a prominent northwest lobe which extends up to 3?.0 away from the central star and is estimated to have formed from an eruptive event around 1,900 years ago;structure
It has a circular part whose walls precisely follow a Hubble-type outflow (where outflow speed is proportional to distance from the central source).;structure
The Trifid Nebula was the subject of an investigation by astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope in 1997, using filters that isolate emission from hydrogenatoms, ionized sulfur atoms, and doubly ionized oxygen atom. ;structure
Its apparent magnitude is 6.3.;structure
The cluster associated with the nebula has approximately 8100 stars, which are mostly concentrated in a gap in the molecular cloud to the north-west of the Pillars.;structure
The Eagle Nebula is part of a diffuse emission nebula, or H II region, which is catalogued as IC 4703.;structure
This region of active current star formation is about 7000 light-years distant.;structure
A black hole, surrounded by a ring of dust, is thought to exist at the heart of the spiral.;structure
Spanning 165 light-years in diameter, M5 is one of the largest known globular clusters. ;structure
The galaxy has a normal looking arm and an extended arm that is less tightly wound. ;structure
